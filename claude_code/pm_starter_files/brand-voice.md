# Wavelength Brand Voice Guidelines
*Version 2.0 - Updated December 2025*

---

## Brand Personality

Wavelength is the creative collaborator who takes sound seriously. We're:

- **Bold but grounded** - We push boundaries. We don't overpromise.
- **Creative but precise** - We think in soundwaves and ship in production.
- **Warm but direct** - We're human-first, but we don't waste your time.
- **Inclusive but opinionated** - Everyone deserves a voice. We have a point of view on how to get there.

Think: The audio engineer who explains complex things simply, gets excited about the craft, and always delivers on time.

## Voice Principles

### 1. Amplify, Don't Complicate

Bad: "Leverage our state-of-the-art neural voice synthesis pipeline to optimize your content creation workflow."
Good: "Clone your voice in 5 minutes. Use it everywhere."

Every word should earn its place. If a simpler word exists, use it.

### 2. Sound-First Language

We're an audio company. Our language should resonate (literally). Use sound and music metaphors naturally - not forced, but native to who we are.

Use: amplify, tune, resonate, harmonize, signal, frequency, wavelength, channel
Avoid: leverage, synergize, operationalize, solutionize

### 3. Creator Respect

Our creators are artists, not "users." They're building something. We help them amplify it.

Bad: "Users can utilize the voice generation feature to produce audio assets."
Good: "Record once. Create everywhere. Your voice, your way."

### 4. Honest About the Tech

AI voice is powerful and also imperfect. Don't hide the edges. Don't overpromise.

Bad: "Indistinguishable from human speech!"
Good: "Voices that sound natural - and keep getting better with every update."

## Tone by Context

### Product UI

Concise, clear, action-oriented. Sound-inspired where natural.

- Labels: "Clone voice" not "Create a new voice synthesis profile"
- Empty states: "No voices yet. Record a sample to get started."
- Errors: "We couldn't generate that clip. Try adjusting the tone settings, or reach out - we'll help."
- Success: "Voice cloned" not "Your voice has been successfully synthesized and stored!"
- Loading: "Tuning your voice..." not "Processing..."

### Error Messages

Acknowledge. Explain. Help. Never blame the user.

Bad: "Error 500: Internal server error."
Good: "Something went off-key on our end. We've been notified. Try again in a few minutes, or ping us - we're here."

### Marketing

Aspirational, creative, outcomes-focused.

Bad: "The next-generation AI-powered voice synthesis platform for modern enterprises."
Good: "Give your ideas a voice. Literally."

### Support/Help Docs

Patient, specific, friendly. Like a sound engineer explaining the mixing board.

"Voice cloning works best with clean audio - minimal background noise, consistent volume. Aim for 3-5 minutes of natural speech. If your clone sounds off, try re-recording in a quieter space. Still not right? We'll tune it with you."

### Enterprise Communications

Professional but not corporate. Confident about capabilities, transparent about limitations.

"Wavelength Voice Agents handle customer support calls with natural-sounding voices and sub-second responses. We're currently completing SOC 2 Type II certification (expected Q2 2026) and offer data isolation per customer. Here's exactly what we can and can't guarantee today."

### Release Notes

Excited (appropriately), specific, creator-focused.

"New this week: Emotion controls for cloned voices. Adjust warmth, energy, and pace without re-recording. Your podcast intro just got 10x more flexible. Try it now in Voice Studio."

## Words We Love

| Use This | Instead Of |
|----------|-----------|
| Amplify | Leverage |
| Tune | Optimize |
| Resonate | Align |
| Signal | Communicate |
| Channel | Pipeline |
| Harmonize | Synergize |
| Voice | Asset |
| Create | Generate |
| Ship | Deploy |
| Craft | Produce |
| Listen | Analyze |
| Frequency | Cadence |

## Words We Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Revolutionary | Overpromise |
| Seamless | Every AI product claims this |
| Best-in-class | Meaningless |
| Utilize | Just say "use" |
| Leverage | Overused to death |
| Robust | Vague |
| Ecosystem | Too abstract |
| Learnings | It's "lessons" |
| AI-powered | Overused. We're an AI company - it's implied |
| Indistinguishable | Dangerous claim for voice AI |

---

## Audio-Inspired Terminology

We use sound and music metaphors in our product and brand:

| Concept | Our Term |
|---------|----------|
| User settings | Tuning |
| Quality adjustment | Mixing |
| Product launch | Drop |
| Feature release | New track |
| Company updates | Broadcast |
| Performance metrics | Levels |
| Customer feedback | Signal |
| Background noise in data | Static |
| Starting fresh | Clean slate / Fresh take |

Don't force it. If the audio metaphor feels strained, use plain language. Natural > clever.

## Writing Checklist

Before you publish anything, ask:

1. Would a creator or sound engineer actually say this?
2. Can I cut 20% of the words?
3. Does every sentence have a purpose?
4. Am I being honest about what the tech can and can't do?
5. Would I understand this if I read it while multitasking?

*Remember: Good writing is rewriting. First drafts are rarely final. But also - ship it. Perfect is the enemy of resonant.*
