**Kai:** Mia, thanks so much for making time. We really appreciate it.

**Mia:** Of course! I've been wanting to talk to someone at Wavelength for months. I have... feelings.

**Kai:** *[laughs]* That's exactly what we need. Tell me everything.

**Mia:** Okay so first, I want to say — I love this product. Genuinely. I've built my entire workflow around Wavelength. I run two podcasts. "The Quiet Part" is my main show, I record that with my actual voice. "Night Signal" is a fiction podcast where I use my cloned voice for narration because I literally cannot record fast enough to keep up with the release schedule. Voice Studio made that possible.

**Kai:** That's amazing. How long have you been doing that?

**Mia:** Almost two years. I was one of the early adopters. I remember when the clone quality was... not great. But it got SO good. Like, my listeners can't tell. I did a poll once — "which episodes use AI narration?" — and they couldn't identify them. That's incredible.

**Kai:** Wow.

**Mia:** BUT. *[pauses]* Here's where things get complicated.

**Kai:** I'm ready.

**Mia:** Three months ago, you guys did a model update. Nobody told us. And my voice clone changed. It's subtle but I can hear it. The cadence is slightly different. There's this weird breathiness that wasn't there before. My listeners started asking if I was sick.

**Kai:** Oh no.

**Mia:** Yeah. I submitted a ticket. Got a generic response. I tweeted about it and got some engagement from other creators who noticed the same thing. Then Aria replied and said "we're aware and working on it." That was September. It's November. It's still not the same.

**Kai:** That's really frustrating. I'm sorry.

**Mia:** It IS frustrating. But here's the thing that really scares me. I built my business on your product. If the quality degrades and doesn't come back, I have to re-record everything. That's hundreds of hours. I can't just switch to ElevenLabs because my clone is HERE. I'm locked in. And now I feel like I'm being held hostage by a product that's forgetting about me.

*[pause, Mia takes a breath]*

**Mia:** Sorry, that was dramatic. But that's how it feels.

**Kai:** No, that's exactly the kind of honest feedback we need. Can you tell me more about that feeling of being "forgotten"?

**Mia:** Yeah. So I follow Wavelength on social. I see the announcements. Voice Agents for enterprise! AI customer support! Enterprise pricing! And I'm like... cool. Good for you. But what about me? What about the creators who got you here? The model update that broke my voice — was it because you were optimizing for enterprise latency? Because if so, you literally degraded MY product to make THEIR product better.

**Kai:** I can understand why that would feel that way.

**Mia:** And then the pricing thing. I heard through the creator Discord — not even officially — that pricing is changing. Nobody told me directly. I'm on the Pro Creator plan at $29/month. Is that going away? Am I going to suddenly be paying $99? Because $29 is already a stretch for a solo creator.

**Kai:** I don't have details on pricing changes—

**Mia:** I know you probably can't say. But the fact that I'm hearing about potential pricing changes through Discord gossip instead of a direct email from you guys? That tells me everything about where creators sit in the priority list.

*[background noise — cat meowing]*

**Mia:** Sorry, that's Luna. She has opinions too.

**Kai:** *[laughs]* Luna is welcome. Let me ask about Soundscape — you mentioned you use it occasionally?

**Mia:** Yeah, I use it for ambient sound effects for Night Signal. Forest sounds, city noise, that kind of thing. The sound effects are great. I don't use the music generation because honestly, the legal stuff scared me. If Universal Music is coming after Wavelength for AI music, what happens to the sound effects I generated? Can I still use them? Nobody has told us.

**Kai:** That's a valid concern.

**Mia:** I'm not a lawyer. I just need to know: is the stuff I already generated safe to use? If I publish an episode with Soundscape sound effects, am I going to get a DMCA takedown? That question should have been answered proactively. The fact that I have to ask it... again, tells me where I am on the priority list.

**Kai:** You're right. We should have communicated that better.

*[pause]*

**Kai:** If you could wave a magic wand, what would you want from Wavelength?

**Mia:** First, fix my voice clone. Or at least let me lock my voice to a specific model version so updates don't change it without my permission. Second, tell me what's happening with pricing BEFORE it happens. Give me 90 days notice, not a surprise. Third, have a creator advisory board or something — include us in decisions that affect us. And fourth... just tell me I still matter. Because right now, I feel like I'm yesterday's customer and enterprise is the future.

**Kai:** That's really clear and helpful. Anything else?

**Mia:** One more thing. I would pay MORE — genuinely — for features that help creators. Emotion controls for cloned voices. Better voice direction (like "say this with excitement" or "say this with sadness"). Multi-voice scenes where I can have a conversation between two cloned voices. I've been asking for these for a year. They'd make my podcast 10x better. But instead, you're building enterprise call center features.

**Kai:** Those are great feature ideas.

**Mia:** I know the enterprise money is bigger. I get it. But creators are your soul. We're the ones who tweet about you, who tell friends, who make YouTube videos showing how to use Voice Studio. We're your marketing team. Don't lose us.

**Kai:** Thank you, Mia. This was incredibly valuable.

**Mia:** I hope so. Because I really don't want to have to leave.

## Key Themes
1. Voice clone quality degraded after model update — no communication
2. Creator feels abandoned as company chases enterprise
3. Pricing changes communicated through rumor, not officially
4. Legal concerns about Soundscape content she's already published
5. Willing to pay more for creator-specific features
6. Locked-in — can't easily switch, which creates anxiety
7. Wants model version locking, transparency, creator advisory board
