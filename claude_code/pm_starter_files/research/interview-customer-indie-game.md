**Kai:** Sam, thanks for chatting. Tell me about how you're using Wavelength.

**Sam:** Yeah, so I'm a one-person studio. I'm making Hollowborne — it's a narrative RPG, think Disco Elysium meets Hades. I need a LOT of voice acting. Like, 40+ characters, thousands of lines of dialogue. Hiring voice actors for all of that would cost me $50K+ that I don't have.

**Kai:** And that's where Wavelength comes in?

**Sam:** Exactly. I use Voice Studio to create voices for all my NPCs. Each character has a unique cloned voice based on samples I've created. The blacksmith sounds gruff, the witch sounds ethereal, the shopkeeper sounds cheerful. And Soundscape handles all my ambient sound — forests, caves, battle sounds, UI sound effects.

**Kai:** That's incredible. How's the quality?

**Sam:** The sound effects from Soundscape are great. Honestly, better than most asset libraries I've used. I describe what I want — "crackling campfire in a stone cave with distant wind" — and I get something usable 80% of the time. That's amazing.

**Kai:** And the voices?

**Sam:** *[hesitates]* Here's the thing. The voices are about 90% there. And 90% is somehow worse than 70%.

**Kai:** What do you mean?

**Sam:** At 70% quality, it clearly sounds like AI. Players know it, they accept it, they move on. At 90%, it sounds ALMOST human. And that "almost" is the uncanny valley. Players can't tell what's wrong, they just feel like something is off. It's this weird discomfort. 90% human is creepier than 70% human.

**Kai:** The uncanny valley of voice.

**Sam:** Exactly. What I need is either 99% human (which would be amazing) or I need controls to make it deliberately stylized — like, lean into the artificiality and make it an aesthetic choice. Give me "radio drama voice" or "noir narrator voice" or "fantasy announcer voice." Let me make it INTENTIONALLY not realistic, so players aren't in the uncanny valley.

**Kai:** That's really interesting. What controls do you have now?

**Sam:** Almost none. I can adjust speed and pitch. That's it. What I need is emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, excitement, sarcasm. My game has emotional scenes. When a character discovers their village was destroyed, they shouldn't sound the same as when they're buying potions. Right now, every line of dialogue has the same emotional flatness.

**Kai:** So emotion and tone controls are the big ask?

**Sam:** The BIGGEST ask. I've been requesting this for almost a year. Every time I ask, the response is "it's on our roadmap." But I see you building enterprise phone agents and I'm like... you're teaching AI voices to say "your call is important to us" while I'm over here trying to make a character mourn their dead brother. Different priorities, I guess.

*[laughs, but it's a frustrated laugh]*

**Kai:** That's fair criticism. What about the API?

**Sam:** The API is actually great. I'm a developer, so I integrated it into my game pipeline. I write dialogue in a spreadsheet, run a script, it generates all the audio files and drops them into my project. That workflow is chef's kiss. Whoever designed the API documentation, give them a raise.

**Kai:** Good to hear. Let me ask about the Soundscape legal situation. Are you worried?

**Sam:** *[long pause]* Yes. And I'll tell you why. The music thing — Universal suing over AI-generated music — I get it. AI mimicking real artists is legally sketchy. But sound effects? Is a "crackling fire" copyrightable? Is "sword clashing"? I've generated thousands of sound effects for my game. If the legal situation expands from music to ALL audio generation, I might have to rip every Soundscape asset out of my game. That would set me back months.

**Kai:** That's a reasonable concern.

**Sam:** Nobody from Wavelength has clarified this. Not an email, not a blog post, nothing. I had to piece it together from TechCrunch articles and your CEO's tweets. For a company that's asking me to trust you with a core part of my game's production pipeline, the silence is deafening.

*[sounds of keyboard typing in background]*

**Kai:** What would you need to feel confident continuing to use Wavelength?

**Sam:** Three things. One: emotion controls for voices. Even basic — happy, sad, angry, scared — would transform the product for game devs. Two: explicit legal clarity on sound effects. A public statement that says "sound effects generated by Soundscape are safe to use commercially, regardless of the music situation." Three: a game developer tier or plan. Right now I'm cobbled together across Voice Studio Pro and Soundscape Creator. There's no plan that says "if you're making a game, here's what you need." I'd love a bundle.

**Kai:** What about the community? Open Voice?

**Sam:** I've used some Open Voice community models for background NPC voices — crowd chatter, ambient dialogue. It's cool for that. But the quality isn't production-ready for main characters. I need Voice Studio for the important voices.

**Kai:** Anything else before we wrap?

**Sam:** Just that... game developers are a market you're ignoring. We're not as flashy as enterprise or as numerous as podcasters. But we need voice synthesis more than almost anyone. A single RPG can need more voice lines than an entire podcast season. If you made a product that was specifically designed for game dev — with character voices, emotion controls, batch generation, scene-based direction — you'd own this market. Nobody else is doing it well.

**Kai:** That's a great insight. Thank you, Sam.

**Sam:** Good luck. And seriously — emotion controls. Please.
