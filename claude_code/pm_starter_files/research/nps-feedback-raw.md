## Passive Comments (Score 7-8)

> "The voice quality is amazing but the reliability is unacceptable for production use. We've had 3 outages in 2 months." - Score 8, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "I love Voice Studio but I'm worried you're forgetting about creators. Every announcement is about enterprise. What about us?" - Score 7, Podcaster, Voice Studio

> "Your pricing page gave me a migraine. I still don't understand what I'm paying for." - Score 8, Creator, Voice Studio + Soundscape

> "Good product, getting better. But the latency on Voice Agents makes it unusable for real-time calls. Feels like talking to someone on Mars." - Score 7, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "I love what you're building but I'm scared about the deepfake stuff — will you get shut down?" - Score 8, Creator, Voice Studio

> "Soundscape is great for sound effects. The music side is scary right now with the legal stuff. Using it for music feels risky." - Score 7, Game Dev, Soundscape

> "Open Voice model is amazing but documentation could be better. Took me a week to figure out fine-tuning." - Score 8, Developer, Open Voice

> "Voice quality: 10/10. Everything else (reliability, support, enterprise features): 5/10." - Score 7, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "Good but not enterprise-ready. We want to use Voice Agents for our support line but can't without SOC 2 and SLAs." - Score 8, Enterprise, Voice Agents

## Detractor Comments (Score 0-6)

> "You updated the model and broke my voice clone. I've been using it for my podcast for a year and suddenly it sounds different. Nobody warned me. I'm furious." - Score 3, Podcaster, Voice Studio

> "800ms latency is a joke for customer support. Customers literally hang up thinking the call dropped. Switching to Amazon Connect." - Score 2, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "I asked for SOC 2 documentation and was told 'we're working on it.' That was 4 months ago. My procurement team won't approve without it." - Score 4, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "The AI voice agent told a customer they could get a full refund on a non-refundable item. Cost us $8K. Where are the guardrails?" - Score 1, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "With the Universal Music lawsuit, I don't trust that my generated content won't get me in legal trouble. Pausing my account until this is resolved." - Score 5, Creator, Soundscape

> "Pricing is incomprehensible. I'm on 3 different plans for 3 products and I have no idea what I'm paying for. Just give me one number." - Score 4, Creator, Voice Studio + Soundscape

> "I love the tech but the deepfake thing is terrifying. What's stopping someone from cloning MY voice? A checkbox? Really?" - Score 6, Creator, Voice Studio

> "Enterprise voice agents need to handle angry callers. Yours freezes when someone interrupts. That's a dealbreaker for a call center." - Score 3, Enterprise, Voice Agents

> "The voice agent can't handle basic multi-turn conversations. Customer asks a follow-up and the agent repeats the same answer. It's embarrassing." - Score 4, Enterprise, Voice Agents

## Themes Analysis

### Why Promoters Love Us
1. Voice quality is genuinely best-in-class
2. Voice Studio empowers creators to produce more content
3. Open source community goodwill
4. Sound effects generation quality
5. API developer experience
6. "The future" feeling — genuinely innovative technology

### Why Detractors Are Frustrated
1. Voice Agents latency (800ms unacceptable for production)
2. Model update broke Voice Studio clones without warning
3. No SOC 2 or enterprise compliance
4. AI hallucination / no guardrails for agents
5. Deepfake / trust & safety concerns
6. Music legal situation creating uncertainty
7. Pricing confusion across product lines
8. Voice agents can't handle interruptions or multi-turn conversations

### NPS Trend Concern

NPS dropped 13 points in 6 months (from +51 to +38). Primary drivers:
- Voice Agents enterprise detractors pulling score down dramatically (+8 NPS)
- Creator concern about being deprioritized
- Trust & safety / deepfake anxiety across all segments
- Music legal uncertainty affecting Soundscape sentiment

Voice Studio NPS (+52) and Open Voice NPS (+48) remain healthy. The drop is driven almost entirely by Voice Agents (+8) and the halo effect of the deepfake/legal news on other products.

If Voice Agents NPS doesn't improve, overall NPS could drop below +30, which signals serious brand damage.
