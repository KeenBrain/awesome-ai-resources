**Kai:** Marcus, thanks for chatting. I want to understand the sales perspective on our products.

**Marcus:** Appreciate you asking. I feel like Sales and Product are on different planets sometimes. We're out there talking to customers every day and the feedback doesn't make it back.

**Kai:** Let's fix that. What's resonating with enterprise buyers?

**Marcus:** The voice quality. Full stop. When I demo Voice Agents, there's always this moment — I play a sample call and the buyer goes "wait, that's the AI?" Every. Single. Time. The quality is genuinely our moat. Nobody sounds as good as us. Not ElevenLabs, not Amazon, not Google. When the voice is good, the demo sells itself.

**Kai:** So what goes wrong after the demo?

**Marcus:** *[exhales]* Everything else.

**Kai:** Walk me through it.

**Marcus:** Okay. So the demo goes great. Buyer is excited. They want to move forward. Then we get to the procurement process. And this is where enterprise deals die.

First question: "Do you have SOC 2?" Us: "We're working on it." Deal risk: immediate.

Second question: "What's your SLA?" Us: "We offer best-effort reliability." Buyer's face: 😐

Third question: "Can you explain the pricing?" Me: *[laughs]* Let me try.

**Kai:** The pricing. Tell me about that.

**Marcus:** So I need to explain that Voice Agents is priced per-minute of conversation time. But it depends on the model tier — Standard, Professional, or Ultra. And there's a base platform fee. And overage charges. And if they also want Voice Studio for custom voice creation, that's a separate subscription with per-character pricing. And if they want Soundscape for hold music, that's per-minute of music generated.

I literally drew this on a whiteboard for a buyer last month. At the end, I looked at the whiteboard and confused MYSELF. The buyer said "I can't take this to my CFO." He was right.

**Kai:** What's the competitive situation on pricing?

**Marcus:** ElevenLabs has three tiers. Simple. Clear. "Starter, Pro, Enterprise." I can look at their pricing page and understand it in 30 seconds. Ours takes a PhD in combinatorics.

**Kai:** What else is losing deals?

**Marcus:** The identity crisis. I had a $400K deal with a financial services company. The buyer was ready to sign. Then he asked: "So is Wavelength a podcasting tool or an enterprise platform?" And I didn't have a good answer. Because we're both. And neither. And the website has creators on the homepage right next to enterprise case studies. His exact words were: "I'm not going to deploy a podcaster tool in our call center."

**Kai:** Did you lose that deal?

**Marcus:** To ElevenLabs. They have SOC 2, simple pricing, and they don't have podcasters on their enterprise landing page. Oh, and they don't have a music product getting sued by Universal Music. That came up in the security review.

*[Marcus pulls up Salesforce]*

**Marcus:** Let me give you the numbers. This year, I've personally worked 24 enterprise deals. Closed 8. Lost 16. Here's why we lost:

- No SOC 2: 6 deals (~$1.8M total ARR)
- Pricing confusion: 4 deals (~$600K)
- Latency concerns: 3 deals (~$450K)
- "Identity crisis" / positioning: 2 deals (~$500K)
- Deepfake press / brand risk: 1 deal (~$400K)

Total lost revenue I can specifically attribute: $3.75 million in ARR.

**Kai:** $3.75 million.

**Marcus:** And those are just MY deals. We have 3 enterprise AEs. Multiply by three... roughly. Not every deal has the same profile, but the themes are consistent. We're leaving $8-10 million on the table because of things that aren't the product's CORE quality. The voice is incredible. Everything around the voice is broken.

*[pause]*

**Kai:** Tell me about what you need from Product.

**Marcus:** Give me a simple story I can tell.

**Kai:** What does that mean specifically?

**Marcus:** When I walk into a meeting, I need to answer three questions in 30 seconds:

One: "What is Wavelength?" Something like: "Wavelength Voice Agents lets you deploy AI-powered phone agents that sound indistinguishable from humans, at a fraction of the cost of human agents."

Two: "Why Wavelength over Amazon/ElevenLabs?" Something like: "Best voice quality in the market, enterprise-grade security, and a platform that scales from 10 to 10,000 agents."

Three: "How much does it cost?" Something like: "$X per agent per month, or $Y per minute. That's it."

Right now, I can answer one and I fumble two and three.

**Kai:** What else?

**Marcus:** SOC 2. Get it done. I don't care how. Every month we delay, we lose deals. I know it's expensive and boring and nobody wants to work on compliance. But it's literally the most revenue-generating thing we could do.

Second: give me enterprise SLAs. I need to tell customers "99.9% uptime, sub-300ms latency, or we give you credits." Not "best effort." Enterprise buyers need contracts with teeth.

Third: separate the enterprise experience from the creator experience. I'm not asking you to abandon creators. I'm asking for an enterprise landing page, enterprise pricing, and enterprise case studies that don't mention podcasting. Let me sell to VPs of Operations without them seeing TikToker testimonials.

**Kai:** What about the music legal situation? How does that affect sales?

**Marcus:** It's come up in 5 deals. Two dropped us from consideration immediately after reading the TechCrunch article. Three asked about it and I had to explain that Soundscape is a separate product and the legal issues don't affect Voice Agents. Which is technically true but they don't care about technicalities. The headline says "Wavelength" and that's what they associate with the brand.

We need a public response that says "here's what happened, here's what we're doing, here's why your voice data is safe." Not the vague tweet from Aria. A real enterprise-grade communication.

**Kai:** Anything else?

**Marcus:** One more thing. I need customer references. Right now, when a buyer asks "who else uses this?" I can name three companies. Two are small. One is a pilot. That's not compelling. I need 2-3 real enterprise case studies with metrics: "Company X deployed Voice Agents, handled Y calls, saved Z dollars." Give me social proof and I can close deals. Without it, every deal is a leap of faith for the buyer.

**Kai:** Thank you, Marcus. This is incredibly valuable.

**Marcus:** Please make sure this goes somewhere. I'm tired of losing deals we should win.

## Key Themes
1. Voice quality is the clear differentiator — demos sell themselves
2. No SOC 2 = $1.8M in lost deals (Marcus alone)
3. Pricing is incomprehensible — literally confused himself on whiteboard
4. Identity crisis: "podcasting tool or enterprise platform?"
5. $3.75M in attributable lost ARR from enterprise readiness gaps
6. Needs simple story: what, why us, how much
7. Enterprise SLAs with financial penalties needed
8. Separate enterprise and creator experiences
9. Music legal situation affecting enterprise brand perception
10. Needs customer case studies with metrics for social proof
