# Persona: Mia the Podcaster

## Overview

**Name:** Mia Chen
**Age:** 30
**Title:** Independent Podcaster & Content Creator
**Shows:** "The Quiet Part" (interview show), "Night Signal" (fiction podcast)
**Audience:** 50K combined subscribers
**Experience:** 4 years podcasting, former marketing manager

---

## Background

Mia left a marketing job at a tech startup two years ago to podcast full-time. She runs two shows and produces all the content herself — writing, recording, editing, publishing. She discovered Wavelength Voice Studio in early 2023 and it changed her workflow: she clones her voice for narration on Night Signal, allowing her to produce twice the content in the same time.

She was one of Wavelength's earliest creator customers and has been vocal about the product (positive and negative) on social media. She's price-sensitive — podcasting doesn't pay well until you hit 100K+ subscribers — and she's built her entire production pipeline around Wavelength.

## Goals

1. **Produce more content without burning out** - She needs to release weekly on both shows. Voice cloning lets her do that solo.

2. **Maintain audio quality** - Her listeners are audio nerds. They notice quality changes. Consistency matters.

3. **Keep costs low** - She's on the $29/month Creator plan. Every dollar matters when you're self-employed.

4. **Grow her audience** - More content, better quality, wider distribution = more subscribers.

---

## Frustrations

1. **Voice clone quality changed** - After the September model update, her clone sounds slightly different. Listeners noticed. She's been asking for a fix for months.

2. **Feeling abandoned** - Every Wavelength announcement is about enterprise. "What about the creators who got you here?"

3. **No communication** - Hears about pricing changes and model updates through Discord gossip, not official channels.

4. **Locked in** - Can't easily switch to a competitor because her voice clone is on Wavelength. Feels trapped.

5. **Soundscape legal uncertainty** - Uses Soundscape sound effects for Night Signal. Nobody has told her if existing generated content is safe to use.

## Quotes (from research)

> "I built my business on your product and now I feel like an afterthought."

> "If the quality degrades and doesn't come back, I have to re-record everything. That's hundreds of hours."

> "I would pay MORE for features that help creators. Emotion controls, multi-voice scenes, voice direction. I've been asking for a year."

> "Don't lose your soul chasing enterprise money."

## How Wavelength Helps Her

- Voice cloning enables 2x content output as a solo creator
- Sound effects from Soundscape add production value
- API integration with her production pipeline saves hours
- Quality (when it works) is genuinely best-in-class

## Where Wavelength Falls Short (Current)

- Voice clone quality degradation (model update)
- No model version pinning (can't lock to a known-good version)
- No emotion/tone controls for voice generation
- Pricing changes communicated via rumor, not official channels
- Legal uncertainty about Soundscape content
- Feeling deprioritized as company chases enterprise
