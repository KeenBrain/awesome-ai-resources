## Growth Thesis

*In one to two sentences, what is the core belief driving our growth strategy?*

> Example: "Wavelength grows when creators discover that AI voice tools save them 5+ hours per week — so our growth engine should be built around demonstrating time-to-value fast."

## Current Funnel Metrics

*Snapshot of where we are. Fill in actuals and conversion rates.*

| Stage | Metric | Current | Target | Conversion Rate |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Awareness** | Monthly unique visitors | | | — |
| **Activation** | Completed first [key action] | | | % |
| **Retention** | W4 retention rate | | | % |
| **Revenue** | Paid conversion rate | | | % |
| **Referral** | Users who refer 1+ friend | | | % |

*Biggest bottleneck right now:* [Stage] — [Why]

## Growth Levers

### Acquisition
- [Channel / tactic 1]
- [Channel / tactic 2]

### Activation
- [What gets a new user to their "aha moment"?]
- [Current time-to-value: X minutes — target: Y minutes]

### Retention
- [What brings users back? What are the natural usage loops?]

### Monetization
- [Pricing lever or upsell path]

### Referral
- [What makes this product shareable? What's the referral mechanic?]

## Prioritized Experiments

*Rank by expected impact. Run no more than 3-5 experiments at a time.*

| # | Experiment | Lever | Hypothesis | Metric | Effort | Expected Impact |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | | | "If we [change], then [metric] will [move] because [reason]" | | S/M/L | High / Med / Low |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
