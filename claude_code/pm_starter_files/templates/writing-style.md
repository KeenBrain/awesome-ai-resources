## The Golden Rules

### 1. Write Like You Talk

Bad: "It is recommended that stakeholders leverage cross-functional synergies."
Good: "Work with other teams."

Read your writing out loud. If you wouldn't say it in a meeting, don't write it.

### 2. Cut the Filler

Delete these phrases - they add nothing:
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "It should be noted that" → [delete entirely]
- "Basically" → [delete entirely]
- "Actually" → [delete entirely]
- "Going forward" → [delete entirely]
- "As per our discussion" → [delete entirely]

### 3. Be Specific

Bad: "We saw significant improvement in key metrics."
Good: "Response time dropped from 3 days to 4 hours."

Numbers > adjectives. Examples > abstractions.

### 4. Use Active Voice

Bad: "The report was written by the team."
Good: "The team wrote the report."

Bad: "Mistakes were made."
Good: "We made mistakes."

### 5. One Idea Per Sentence

Bad: "The project was delayed because the requirements changed and the team was understaffed, which meant we had to reprioritize and push back the deadline, though we're now back on track."

Good: "The project was delayed. Requirements changed mid-sprint and we were understaffed. We've reprioritized and set a new deadline. We're back on track."

## Formatting Rules

- **Short paragraphs** - 3-4 sentences max
- **Bullet points** - When listing more than 2 items
- **Headers** - Break up long documents
- **Bold** - For key terms, not for emphasis
- **One space** - After periods, not two

## The Final Test

Before sending, ask yourself:
1. Would I say this out loud to a colleague?
2. Can I cut 20% of the words?
3. Is there a simpler word for any jargon?
4. Does every sentence earn its place?
5. What's the one thing the reader needs to know?

If the answer to any of these is "no," revise.

## Examples

### Before (Corporate)
"We are pleased to announce that we have successfully completed a comprehensive analysis of our customer feedback data, and we believe that the insights derived from this analysis will enable us to make more informed decisions regarding our product roadmap going forward."

### After (Human)
"We analyzed customer feedback. Here's what we learned and how it changes our roadmap."

*Remember: Good writing is rewriting. First drafts are rarely final.*
