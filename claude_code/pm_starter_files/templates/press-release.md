# Press Release (Working Backwards)

*Write this BEFORE you build. If you can't write a compelling press release, rethink the feature. This is a thinking tool — not a marketing deliverable.*

---

## [HEADLINE]

*One sentence that a customer would get excited about. No buzzwords.*

> Example: "Wavelength Launches Real-Time Voice Translation, Letting Podcasters Reach Listeners in 30+ Languages"

### [SUBHEADLINE]

*One sentence that adds the key detail the headline left out.*

---

**[City, State] — [Date]** —

### The Announcement

*Opening paragraph: Who is this for, what is the product/feature, and why should anyone care? Write this as if a journalist will copy-paste it.*

[Wavelength today announced [feature/product], enabling [target customer] to [key benefit]. Starting [date], users can [what they can do] directly from [where].]

### The Problem

*What specific, painful problem does this solve? Make the reader nod.*

[Before today, [target customer] struggled with [problem]. This meant [consequence — wasted time, lost revenue, poor experience]. Despite [existing alternatives], [gap that remains].]

### The Solution

*How does this solve the problem? Focus on outcomes, not architecture.*

[With [feature name], [target customer] can now [key capability]. This works by [brief, plain-language explanation]. The result: [measurable or tangible improvement].]

### Quote from Leadership

*Voice of the company. Should reinforce the "why now" and the vision.*

> "[Quote that explains why this matters and what it signals about where the company is headed.]"
>
> — [Name], [Title], Wavelength

### How It Works

*Three to four bullet points. Simple enough for a non-technical reader.*

1. [Step or capability]
2. [Step or capability]
3. [Step or capability]

### Customer Quote

*Voice of the user. Should be specific and believable — not generic praise.*

> "[Quote describing the specific problem they had and how this changes things for them.]"
>
> — [Name], [Title], [Company/Context]

### Call to Action

*Reminder: This is a thinking exercise. Test your press release with these questions:*
- *Would a customer actually be excited reading this?*
- *Is the benefit clear in the headline alone?*
- *Could you cut the solution paragraph in half and lose nothing?*
- *Is the customer quote something a real person would say?*
