## Tips

- Subject line should be informative - recipient should know status without opening
- Put most important info first - assume they stop reading after 30 seconds
- Use tables for data - easier to scan than paragraphs
- Be honest about risks - surprises are worse than bad news
- Include clear next steps with owners and dates
- Keep under 300 words for routine updates
