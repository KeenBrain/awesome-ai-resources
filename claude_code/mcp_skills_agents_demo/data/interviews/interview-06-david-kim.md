# User Interview: David Kim

## Background

David Kim is the CEO and Co-founder of NexaFlow, a workflow automation platform with 300 employees and $40M ARR. He uses the analytics dashboard primarily for executive-level oversight, board reporting, and strategic decision-making. He has been on the platform for 18 months on the Enterprise plan. He values high-level summaries over granular data and frequently checks metrics on his phone.

## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer**: David, thanks for making time. I know CEO schedules are tight. How does the analytics dashboard fit into your day?

**David**: It's supposed to be my morning ritual. Wake up, coffee, check the dashboard on my phone. See where we stand on key metrics -- revenue, user growth, conversion, engagement. Then I walk into the office with a data-informed perspective on the day. That's the theory, anyway. The reality is a bit different.

**Interviewer**: How so?

**David**: The first thing is -- and I'll just be direct -- **we don't have a funnel view. For a CEO, the funnel IS the business.** How many people enter the top, how many convert at each stage, where are we losing them? That's the most fundamental view of any SaaS business, and it simply doesn't exist in the dashboard. I have to ask my VP of Growth to compile that from multiple sources every week.

**Interviewer**: What does that compilation process look like from your perspective?

**David**: From my perspective, it means I get a slide deck every Monday with funnel numbers that are already a few days old. It means I'm making strategic decisions based on lagging data. **If I had a real-time funnel visualization, I could spot issues before my team even notices them.** Last month, our signup-to-activation rate dropped 15% over a weekend because of a broken onboarding flow. We didn't catch it until Wednesday because the funnel data was in a manual report that only updates weekly.

**Interviewer**: That broken onboarding flow -- tell me more about that.

**David**: A deploy on Friday inadvertently broke the welcome wizard for new users. Signups were fine, but activation cratered. **If we had a funnel chart showing real-time drop-off between signup and activation, someone would have caught it Saturday morning. Instead, we lost three days of new user activations.** That's roughly 200 users who signed up and immediately bounced. Most of them won't come back.

**Interviewer**: That's a significant business impact. What other dashboard limitations affect you?

**David**: Mobile. I mentioned I check the dashboard on my phone. Well, "check" is generous. **The dashboard on mobile is a disaster. Nothing is sized correctly, the charts are unreadable, and I can't interact with anything.** I end up zooming in and panning around like I'm looking at a treasure map. It's 2025 -- responsive design should be a given, not a feature request.

**Interviewer**: How often do you try to use it on mobile?

**David**: Every single day. I'm at conferences, in Ubers, at dinners -- I always want a quick pulse on the business. **Mobile is my primary interface for the dashboard, and it's the worst experience.** I've actually resorted to having my EA screenshot the dashboard on her laptop and text me the images when I need numbers on the go. That is a ludicrous workflow for a product I'm paying enterprise pricing for.

**Interviewer**: What would a good mobile experience look like for you as a CEO?

**David**: Simple. Give me 5 cards with the 5 most important metrics. Big numbers, clear trend indicators -- up arrow green, down arrow red. Below that, a simplified funnel summary. Everything should be tappable to drill in if I want more detail. **I don't want the desktop dashboard on my phone. I want a mobile dashboard designed for how executives consume data -- at a glance, on the go, in 30 seconds or less.**

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about something different. When new team members join NexaFlow, how do they get started with the dashboard?

**David**: This is actually a hidden problem. We onboard maybe 5-10 new dashboard users a month as we grow. Right now, **there's no onboarding experience at all. New users log in and see a wall of charts with no context.** My VP of Marketing logged in for the first time last month and literally said, "What am I looking at?" She's a smart person, but the dashboard assumes you already know what everything means.

**Interviewer**: Has this created any real problems?

**David**: It creates a support burden on my data team. Every new user generates a flurry of Slack messages -- "What does this metric mean?", "How do I see only my team's data?", "What time range is this showing?" My data analyst has started writing a FAQ document, but it's already 15 pages and nobody reads it. **A simple onboarding tutorial or guided walkthrough when you first log in would eliminate probably 80% of those questions.** Tooltips on charts, a "getting started" wizard, something.

**Interviewer**: Is onboarding something you'd prioritize highly?

**David**: It's not my top priority, but it has a multiplicative effect. **Better onboarding means more people using the dashboard independently, which means fewer requests on my data team, which means my data team can focus on actual analysis instead of tech support.** It's not urgent, but it compounds over time.

**Interviewer**: Going back to mobile and funnels -- how do these gaps affect your board meetings?

**David**: Significantly. My board asks about conversion funnels every single meeting. They want to see top-of-funnel, mid-funnel, and bottom-of-funnel metrics with drop-off rates. **Without a funnel visualization, my team spends 3-4 hours before every board meeting manually assembling funnel data from multiple sources into a coherent narrative.** And because it's manual, there's always a risk of errors. We had a board meeting where two slides showed conflicting conversion numbers because they were pulled from different sources at different times.

**Interviewer**: How did the board react?

**David**: About how you'd expect. They questioned our data rigor. We had to spend 15 minutes of a 60-minute board meeting explaining the discrepancy instead of discussing strategy. **A single, authoritative funnel view would eliminate that class of problem entirely.** One source of truth, always up to date, always consistent.

**Interviewer**: You mentioned the dashboard loading performance earlier in passing. Can you elaborate?

**David**: It's slow. When I try to load it on mobile over cellular, sometimes it takes 20+ seconds. Even on desktop with good wifi, it's 8-10 seconds. **For my use case -- quick morning check, glance between meetings -- anything over 3 seconds is too slow.** I don't have the patience to wait, and more importantly, I don't have the time. If it takes 15 seconds to load, I'll just skip it and ask someone for an update instead.

**Interviewer**: If you could fix three things about the dashboard, what would they be?

**David**: Funnel visualization -- it's the core view of my business and it's missing. Mobile responsiveness -- I need to check metrics on my phone without fighting the interface. And a basic onboarding experience -- so my growing team can self-serve instead of bugging the data team. **Funnels and mobile would immediately impact my daily workflow. Onboarding would reduce organizational drag as we scale.**

**Interviewer**: How patient are you with these issues? Is this something that needs to happen in weeks, months?

**David**: Funnels -- I need it this quarter. We're going into a fundraising round and I need clean funnel data for investor conversations. Mobile -- honestly, I've needed it for a year. **If we don't have a usable funnel view and a decent mobile experience within the next 60 days, I'm going to start evaluating alternatives.** I say this as someone who really doesn't want to switch -- migration is expensive and disruptive. But the gaps are too significant to ignore.

**Interviewer**: Any final thoughts?

**David**: You've built a good data foundation. The metrics are accurate, the integrations are solid, the real-time aspect is valuable. **But you're leaving massive value on the table by not having funnels, not working on mobile, and not onboarding users properly.** These aren't nice-to-haves. For a CEO, funnels and mobile are must-haves. Fix those and I'm your biggest champion. Leave them broken and I'm your biggest flight risk.

**Interviewer**: Very direct feedback, David. We appreciate it.

**David**: That's what you hired me to give you. [laughs] Good luck. I'm pulling for you.
